Got done: fixed one of the issues, cleaned up code a lot(Still needs quite a bit of work)

Issue: when running the "test" function, the tetrisCube ends up having more than 12 pieces

What I think is casuing the issue: I believe that some of my objects are referencing the same object when they should be seperate, causing changes I do not intend.

fixed one of the issues causing the cube to be falsely updated everytime the piece was put in.
still issues

Solution: TBD

Figured out the issue that was cuasing the pieces to be placed over and over
moved collision check into the Piece class to get it working

Got Done: iterateThroughPieces now actually places piece :D

Mostly used ChatGPT to fix the rotation class and get all the unique rotations for each Piece
Rotations is now working and replaces rotatePiece.java

Got Done: Got every unique rotation for each piece stored in an arrayList
:D
