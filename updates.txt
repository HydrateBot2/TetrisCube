Got done: fixed one of the issues, cleaned up code a lot(Still needs quite a bit of work)

Issue: when running the "test" function, the tetrisCube ends up having more than 12 pieces

What I think is casuing the issue: I believe that some of my objects are referencing the same object when they should be seperate, causing changes I do not intend.

fixed one of the issues causing the cube to be falsely updated everytime the piece was put in.
still issues

Solution: TBD
